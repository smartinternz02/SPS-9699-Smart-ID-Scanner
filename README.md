# SPS-9699-Smart-ID-Scanner


-- To develop an end-to-end application where users can register and login to their respective accounts.

-- Once logged in, the user should be able to upload an image for text extraction. Then the API sends the image for processing.

-- Such images may contain important textual data that the user may need to edit or store digitally. This can be done using Optical Character Recognition with the help of Tesseract OCR Engine.

-- OCR is a branch of artificial intelligence that is used in applications to recognize text from scanned documents or images.

-- Users get the extracted text from the image.
